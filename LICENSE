Magic is not Open Source or Free Software, even though most of its code is
publicly available - And you will need one license key for each production
machine you intend to install it on. During development and testing however,
you can use it for free, as you evaluate Magic. But once you decide to put
Magic into production, you will need one license key for each hostname you
intend to run Magic on.

If you create Free and Open Source Software however, and you publicly make
your source code available for everybody to download - I might give you a
free license key, to run it free of charge, on one production server,
associated with one hostname.
